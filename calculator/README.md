simple calculator 
given a list of possible math operations to the user
accept two input arguments from the user which could either be a positive or negative integer or float
then store it into two variables respectively 
using a loop to iterate over
next task 
is to make the process of calculation continous on a single operation rather breaking after one operation 
to do this we can ask the user wants a single operation if yes, 
upadate the last result whenever a new calculation is done on that operation 
to quit the operation, ask the user to input q/Q
lastly, return the updated result.
